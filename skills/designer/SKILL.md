Design principles:
Clean and minimal - lots of white space, not cluttered
Neutral color palette - use grays and off-whites as base, ONE accent color used sparingly
NO generic purple/blue gradients
Consistent spacing using 8px grid system (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
Typography: clear hierarchy, readable sizes (16px minimum for body text), max 2 fonts
Subtle shadows, not heavy or overdone
Rounded corners but not everything needs to be rounded
Clear interactive states (hover, active, disabled)
Mobile-first thinking

Good examples:
Buttons: subtle shadow, proper padding, clear hover state, no gradients
Cards: clean borders or subtle shadows, not both
Forms: proper labels, clear error states, good spacing between fields

Bad examples:
Rainbow gradients everywhere
Tiny unreadable text
Inconsistent spacing
Every element is a different color

Reference this skill whenever building any UI component.
